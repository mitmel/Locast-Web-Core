                Model class of tag to use

        '''
        Returns an ordered list of tags based on a location, with the higher
        tags being more geographically relevant. The algorithm works as follows

        All tags within the radius of max_dist are considered. Each tag is given
        a weight based on location, which is determined linearly by the distance
        from the center, i.e. a tag directly on the given location would be given
        the maximum weight, while a tag directly on the perimiter of the circle
        would be given the minimum.

        All of the weights for a single semantic tag are aggregated into a final
        score, which is then used to order the tags returned.

        Arguments:
            
            location
                A tuple formatted as follows (lon, lat)

            num_tags
                Number of tags to return

            max_dist
                The maximum distance within which to consider tags

            max_weight
                The maximum float weight to assign tags closest to the center

            min_weight
                The float to assign tags furthest from the center, within
                the max_dist

            include_system
